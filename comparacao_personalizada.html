    <p>06/03/25, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>11:14 </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>11:12 </span>Monetary policy decisions PRESS RELEASE Monetary policy decisions <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>30 January </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>6 March </span>2025 The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. In particular, the decision to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which the Governing Council steers the monetary policy stance – is based on its updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. </p>

<p>The disinflation process is well on track. Inflation has continued to develop broadly <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in line </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>as staff expected, and the latest projections closely align </span>with the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>previous inflation outlook. Staff now see headline inflation averaging 2.3% in 2025, 1.9% in 2026 and 2.0% in 2027. The upward revision in headline inflation for 2025 reflects stronger energy price dynamics. For inflation excluding energy and food, </span>staff <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>projections and is set to return to the Governing Council’s 2% medium-term target in the course of this year. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>project an average of 2.2% in 2025, 2.0% in 2026 and 1.9% in 2027. </span></p>

<p><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'></span>Most measures of underlying inflation suggest that inflation will settle at around the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Governing Council’s 2% medium-term </span>target on a sustained basis. Domestic inflation remains high, mostly because wages and prices in certain sectors are still adjusting to the past inflation surge with a substantial delay. But wage growth is moderating as expected, and profits are partially buffering the impact on inflation. </p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>The Governing Council’s recent </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Monetary policy is becoming meaningfully less restrictive, as the </span>interest rate cuts are <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>gradually </span>making new borrowing less expensive for firms and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>households. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>households and loan growth is picking up. </span>At the same time, <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a headwind to the easing of </span>financing conditions <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>continue to be tight, also because monetary policy remains restrictive and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>comes from </span>past interest rate hikes <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are </span>still transmitting to the stock of credit, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>with some maturing loans being rolled over at higher rates. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>and lending remains subdued overall. </span>The economy <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is still facing headwinds but rising </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>faces continued challenges and staff have again marked down their growth projections – to 0.9% for 2025, 1.2% for 2026 and 1.3% for 2027. The downward revisions for 2025 and 2026 reflect lower exports and ongoing weakness in investment, in part originating from high trade policy uncertainty as well as broader policy uncertainty. Rising </span>real incomes and the gradually fading effects of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>restrictive monetary policy should support a </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>past rate hikes remain the key drivers underpinning the expected </span>pick-up in demand over time. </p>

<p>The Governing Council is determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at its 2% medium- term target. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>It </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Especially in current conditions of rising uncertainty, it </span>will follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance. In particular, the Governing Council’s interest rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path. </p>

<p>Key ECB interest rates The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. </p>

<p>Accordingly, the interest rates on the deposit facility, the main refinancing operations and the marginal <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2025/html/ecb.mp250306~d4340800b3.en.html 1/2 06/03/25, 11:12 Monetary policy decisions </span>lending facility will be decreased to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>2.75%, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>2.50%, 2.65% and </span>2.90% <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and 3.15% </span>respectively, with effect from <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>5 February </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>12 March </span>2025. </p>

<p>Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) The APP and PEPP portfolios are declining at a measured and predictable pace, as the Eurosystem no longer reinvests the principal payments from maturing securities. </p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2025/html/ecb.mp250130~530b29e622.en.html 1/3 06/03/25, 11:14 Monetary policy decisions Refinancing operations On 18 December 2024 banks repaid the remaining amounts borrowed under the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, thus concluding this part of the balance sheet normalisation process. ¶ </span><em>*</em> The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments within its mandate to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at its 2% target over the medium term and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission. Moreover, the Transmission Protection Instrument is available to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries, thus allowing the Governing Council to more effectively deliver on its price stability mandate. </p>

<p>The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:45 CET today. </p>
